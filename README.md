Pac man but with a twist! Play with friends, alone or with weird stuff going on! WIP
This game was witten in the processing language, more information on the language can be found at Processing.org
There are three versions, each one is slightly differnt, here are the controls:
For the single player versions pac man is controled with WASD.
For the multiplayer versions the ghosts are controled with FCVB, YGHJ, KMComma and period, and PL;', going down the keyboard.
To compile or run any of them you would need to open it with the processing PDE.
